# FAQ

## What is this game?

This is a rhythm-based game where you jump over obstacles in time to 3 selected songs.

The idea of the game is based off of Geometry Dash.

### Why is it so simple?

It's a final project for a class.

I decided to do something in VB that I have not fully touched upon before (Graphics and painting.)

### Will there be more features?

In the coming days, possibly.

##### Planned for 1.0:
- [x] A few easter eggs within the game
- [x] Icons and UI tweaks
- [x] High score system (least # of attempts for 3 modes)
- Version 1.0 has been released.

##### Some feature ideas for 2.0:
- [ ] "Duck and jump" instead of just jump
- [ ] Auto-analyze music and jumps based on algorithm
- [ ] Multiple jumps at once on screen
- [ ] "Lives" for an extra hard mode
- [ ] Invisibility toggle for an EXTREME challenge.
- [ ] Remove music easter egg (easter egg #2)
- [ ] Fix bugs mentioned in code, and create Mono or similar build for (Mac?)/Linux (My.Computer.Audio.Stop() is the main issue, using Naudio library is a possible alternative)
