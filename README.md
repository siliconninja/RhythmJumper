# RhythmJumper

A rhythm-based game where you jump over obstacles in time to ~~3~~ 2... rhythmic... songs (still finding a third one).

It includes easter eggs & high score functionality.

This is my final project for a computer science class that teaches Visual Basic .NET.

I decided to play around with MonoDevelop in 2022 to revitalize the project by testing out Linux and C# support (through GTK), because why not?

# Play the Game (How to Run)
Download from the Releases tab.

### Windows
First download `RhythmJumper.exe` in the Releases tab.

Then run it.

### Linux
The (alpha) Linux version must be run through Mono.

First download `RhythmJumperLinux.exe` in the Releases tab.

To install the dependencies, run:

* Fedora 35 (tested): `sudo dnf install mono-complete`
* Ubuntu 22.10 (Kinetic, untested): `sudo apt install mono-complete`

Run `mono RhythmJumperLinux.exe` in a terminal window.

## How to compile from source
### Windows
The Windows version is located in the `RhythmJumper` directory. [It uses WinForms and Visual Studio .NET Framework 3.5.](https://github.com/siliconninja/RhythmJumper/blob/master/RhythmJumper/RhythmJumper/RhythmJumper.vbproj#L227)

### Linux
The (alpha) Linux version is located in the `RhythmJumper-Linux` directory. 

Install the following packages:

Fedora 35: `sudo dnf install -y git monodevelop mono-complete mono-basic` (mono-basic may be optional, but it's what I had installed)

[Make sure you copy the **RhythmJumper-Linux** folder to the same project folder specified under Preferences in MonoDevelop.](https://stackoverflow.com/a/50050601) It uses the Gtk# 2.0 framework.

Then click the Play button on the top-left to run the game!

# FAQ

## What is this game?

This is a rhythm-based game where you jump over obstacles in time to 2... rhythmic... songs.

The idea of the game is based off of Geometry Dash.

### Why is it so simple?

It's a final project for a class.

I decided to do something in VB that I have not fully touched upon before (Graphics and painting.)

### Will there be more features?

In the coming days, possibly.

##### Planned for 1.0:
- [x] A few easter eggs within the game
- [x] Icons and UI tweaks
- [x] High score system (least # of attempts for 3 modes)
- Version 1.0 has been released.

##### Some feature ideas for 2.0:
- [ ] "Duck and jump" instead of just jump
- [ ] Auto-analyze music and jumps based on algorithm
- [ ] Multiple jumps at once on screen
- [ ] "Lives" for an extra hard mode
- [ ] Invisibility toggle for an EXTREME challenge.
- [ ] Remove music easter egg (easter egg #2)
- [ ] Fix bugs mentioned in code, and create Mono or similar build for (Mac?)/Linux (My.Computer.Audio.Stop() is the main issue, using Naudio library is a possible alternative)
